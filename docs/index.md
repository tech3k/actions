## Tech3k Managed Deployment Scripts

This page and its links describes how you can use each part of the Managed deployment scripts to ensure that deployment for all projects is extremely easy.

### Initial Setup

To install a Managed Deploy Script the first step is to create a default github action script. First create a blank file in the `.github/workflows` directory. We suggest this be called `deploy.yml` for conventions sake.

```sh
touch .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```
